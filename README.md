Portfolio website for Victor Neves. It was based on [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV7S8BhIeBo&t=11521s), but heavily optimized for SEO, lighthouse score ([100/100](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?psiurl=https%3A%2F%2Fvoaneves.com%2F&strategy=mobile&category=performance&category=accessibility&category=best-practices&category=seo&category=pwa&utm_source=lh-chrome-ext)) and accessibility (it's also a PWA). It's an online portfolio to showcase my web presence, CV, timeline for showing skills, profficiency and also to be hired. [Have a look! SITE URL: voaneves.com](https://voaneves.com)
